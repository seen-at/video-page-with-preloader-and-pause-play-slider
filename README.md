A video is stacked behind the page's content and played in loop. 
A button with play and play option with a switch of 50% length is created. 
The 'slide' class is added to the 'switch-btn' class. The CSS of the 'slide' class causes the switch in the button to move 50% to the left side of the button, which in turn causes the video in the background to pause or play. 

A preloader.gif plays before the entire HTML, CSS and styles content loads. The class of 'hide-preloader' is added to the preloader class in the HTML when the entire page loads.
